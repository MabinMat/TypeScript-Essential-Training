# TypeScript Essential Training

Welcome to the TypeScript Essential Training project! 
This repository will track all the TypeScript concepts and examples that I will be learning.
## Practices and Syntaxes Covered

In this repository, you will find various TypeScript practices and syntaxes demonstrated through example files. These include:

- **Basic Types**: Learn about TypeScript's type system, including primitives, arrays, tuples, and enums.
- **Interfaces**: Understand how to define and implement interfaces to enforce type contracts.
- **Classes**: Explore object-oriented programming with classes, inheritance, and access modifiers.
- **Functions**: Dive into function types, optional parameters, default parameters, and rest parameters.
- **Generics**: Discover how to write reusable and type-safe code with generics.
- **Modules**: Learn about organizing code with ES6 modules and TypeScript namespaces.
- **Type Inference**: Understand how TypeScript infers types and how to use type assertions.
- **Advanced Types**: Explore union types, intersection types, type guards, and type aliases.
- **Decorators**: Get introduced to decorators and how they can be used to modify classes and methods.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Learn about promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous operations in TypeScript.

Each concept is accompanied by practical examples to help you understand and apply TypeScript effectively.
